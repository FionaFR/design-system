      <Paragraph>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its layout.

## Paragraphs

Use on all plain text.

**NB:** Do not use a lot of `<br />` to add space between paragraphs. Instead, use a new paragraph. We want to be consistent.
